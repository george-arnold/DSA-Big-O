## 1. What is the Big O for this?

### 1) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would like to be a playdate for my golden. Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"

#### O(1)

### 2) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog who is of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You start with the first person and ask him if he has a golden retriever. He says no, then you ask the next person, and the next, and the next until you find someone who has a golden or there is no one else to ask.

#### O(n)

## What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```function isEven(value) {
    if (value % 2 === 0) {
        return true;
    }
    else
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### 0(1) because each operation is still constant time, so it's constant time complexity

## What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```
function areYouHere(arr1, arr2) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        const el1 = arr1[i];
        for (let j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
            const el2 = arr2[j];
            if (el1 === el2) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

#### O(n^k)

## What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```
function doubleArrayValues(array) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { //loops n times
        array[i] *= 2;               //constant time, runs n times
    }
    return array;                  //constant time runs once

}
```

#### O(n)

## Big O

```
function naiveSearch(array, item) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { // loops n times
        if (array[i] === item) {   //constant time, runs n times
            return i;               // runs at MOST n times
        }
    }
}
```

#### O(n) n operations are being run, it has to check each item in the array

7. Compute the sequence

## What does the following algorithm do? What is its runtime complexity? Explain your answer

```
function compute(num) {
    let result = []; // initialize result
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) { //loops through num times

        if (i === 1) {    // constant
            result.push(0); // constant push 0 into the array
        }
        else if (i === 2) {  //constant
            result.push(1);   //constant push 1 into the array
        }
        else {
            result.push(result[i - 2] + result[i - 3]); //constant push results into array
        }
    }
    return result; // return the array
}
```

#### pushes numbers, is an iterative solution to the recursive fib sequence problem, O(n)

8. An efficient search

## In this example, we return to the problem of searching using a more sophisticated approach than in naive search, above. Assume that the input array is always sorted. What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```
function efficientSearch(array, item) {
    let minIndex = 0;
    let maxIndex = array.length - 1;
    let currentIndex;
    let currentElement;

    while (minIndex <= maxIndex) {
        currentIndex = Math.floor((minIndex + maxIndex) / 2);
        currentElement = array[currentIndex];

        if (currentElement < item) {
            minIndex = currentIndex + 1;
        }
        else if (currentElement > item) {
            maxIndex = currentIndex - 1;
        }
        else {
            return currentIndex;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

#### We are cutting the problem in half each time the while look runs, current element is defined as the current index of the array, which is min+max/2. It cuts the problem in half on each run of the loop to narrow down the problem. So there is still growth, but its logarithmic O(log(n))

9. What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

```
function findRandomElement(arr) {
    return arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
}
```

O(1) it does various things, but they're all constant time. It's effectively just pointing at a random number in the array and picking it, doesn't matter how long the array is.

10. What Am I?

What does the following algorithm do? What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function isWhat(n) {
if (n < 2 || n % 1 !== 0) { // constant time
return false; // constant time
}
for (let i = 2; i < n; ++i) { // runs n times
if (n % i === 0) return false; //constant time
}
return true; // constant time
}

#### Searches for prime numbers. Is n divisible by any number below itself? if so, then it is not prime

#### O(n)
